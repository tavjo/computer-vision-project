        "2. **train/obj_loss**: Shows improvement in detecting objects and distinguishing them from the background, indicated by a decreasing trend.\n",
        "3. **train/cls_loss**: Reflects better performance in classifying detected objects, indicated by decreasing loss.\n",
        "4. **metrics/precision**: Increasing precision shows a reduction in false positives, indicating improved model performance.\n",
        "5. **metrics/recall**: Increasing recall indicates the model is identifying more true positives, though a recall above 70% is preferable.\n",
        "6. **val/box_loss**: Decreasing validation box loss shows better generalization to new data.\n",
        "7. **val/obj_loss**: A decreasing trend indicates improved object detection in new data.\n",
        "8. **val/cls_loss**: Decreasing validation classification loss indicates better object classification in new data.\n",
        "9. **metrics/mAP_0.5**: Increasing mAP_0.5 indicates better precision-recall trade-off at an IoU threshold of 0.5.\n",
